# My Django Library Website

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/j9peters/my-django-library-website.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/j9peters/my-django-library-website)


## Description

This is the product of my working through the MDN Web Docs' [Django Tutorial: The Local Library website](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django/Tutorial_local_library_website).

Check out the live version of this repo here: https://alibrarymostlocal.herokuapp.com/


## Customizations

I have added a few customizations to the base library website by:

  - configuring the app for connection with a PostgreSQL database
  - authoring the generic template file [borrowed\_books\_generic.html](catalog/templates)
  - implementing support for librarians to create new book and author records

In addition, I have integrated this GitHub repository with Travis CI. *(Exciting for me, as this is my first time leveraging the Travis platform!!)*
